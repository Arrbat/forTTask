# forTTask
#### A strategic task management app-game that gamifies your real-life goals

# Project Objective:

To provide people with a turnkey solution to gamify their daily tasks, work, and so on. The essence is that the user will be able to keep a record (management) of their goals and tasks, both daily and those in a longer period of time. It is planned that these very ‘goals’ or ‘tasks’ will be presented in the form of ‘enemies’, which must be defeated, thereby expanding their possessions, power and so on. A kind of strategy. 

# Technical aspects:

The project is written in C programming language using Nuklear GUI toolkit (https://immediate-mode-ui.github.io/Nuklear/). At the moment the development is planned only for Windows OS.
