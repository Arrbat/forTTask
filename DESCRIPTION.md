# forTTask

### A strategic task management app-game that gamifies your real-life goals

## Motivation:

forTTask is designed to help people gamify their daily tasks, work, and goals. Users can manage their objectives, both short- and long-term, in an engaging and strategic way. Each "goal" or "task" is represented as an "enemy" that must be defeated, leading to the expansion of one's territory, power, and influence‚Äîsimilar to a strategy game. 

## Technical aspects:

- **Language:** C  
- **GUI Toolkit:** [Nuklear](https://immediate-mode-ui.github.io/Nuklear/)  
- **Platform:** Windows (initial development phase, potential cross-platform expansion)

# MVP description:
1) **Problem to solve:**
  gamefication of your real-life goals and daily tasks to improve motivation and to make the routine more interesting.
2) **Target audience:**
  People, those like time/tasks management, but want another solution for that: minimalistic and exciting.
3) **Completed products to use, alternatives, that the project might look like:**

    [habitica](https://habitica.com/static/home) - RPG gamification

    [excalibur-fun-task-tracker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/excalibur-fun-task-tracker/id6740228933) - RPG gamification 

4) **SWOT-analysis:** `(estimation in the end, from 1 to 5 (low to high))`

     ‚úÖ*Strengths*
     - gamificated goals achievement - depending on your progress/regress state will change. Look at that like loosing some sectors due to bad army in some strategies or conquest of the world due to informed decisions (5)
     - minimalistic and cute design, like games from [yiotro](https://yiotro.com/games/) - clear interface and graphics (4)
     - totally free main functionality (3)
  
     ‚ö†Ô∏è*Weaknesses*
     - lack of financing (1)
     - lack of developers (3)
     - lack of experience (5)
     - first big product (5)
  
     üöÄ*Opportunities*
     - possible release on popular OS (Windows, GNU-Linux, MacOS, Android, IOS) - first of all Windows (3)
     - possible funding (donation first of all) (5)
     - possible scaling (4)
  
     üîª*Threats*
      - fading developer motivation (4)
      - competitors entering the market (1)
      - too long development due to lack of experience (3)

  5) **User`s interaction:**
     The interface will be similar to **[Notion](https://www.notion.com/desktop) or [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)**. However, users will primarily interact with **a graphical map** representing their progress, rather than traditional lists. This will encourage **direct interaction with the game world** instead of just managing tasks in a standard UI.  

  6) **(non)Functional requirements:**
      - typical the simplest task-time manager with interface to interact with map/gpaph/graphics
      - completed graphics design, how everything must look (without big re-designing)
      - simple progress/regress system - if done - progression, if not - regression

  7) **Feedback and testing:** gather feedback, when first pre-mvp will be created. Test app first of all for solving big bugs and problems.
